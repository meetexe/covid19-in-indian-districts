# covid19-in-indian-districts
Here is the code for visualizing district wise condition of COVID-19 in India. The data source is www.covid19india.org
You need to input the name of your district in the variable DTNAME in the string format. I haven't attached any dataset because code will directly take the data from website every time you run the code.

If there is a NameError in the value of DTNAME than you can check the districts in the text file 'district_names'.
